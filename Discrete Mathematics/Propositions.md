Turn in your homework on Wednesday.
This is a command. This command doesn't have a truth value

Akjsdf!
This is not a proposition. This is gibberish.

Who are you?
This is a question which means it doesn't have a truth value

x + 1 = 2.
This is not a proposition. This statement is neither true or false. This statement can be turned into a proposition if we assign a value to x.

x + y = z.
This is not a proposition. This statement is neither true or false. This statement can be turned into a proposition if we assign values to the variables.

Every positive even integer can be written as the sum of two primes 
This is a proposition. We don't know if it is true or false, but we know it's either true or false.
```

### Logical Opporators 

```
Negation(not) | ¬p
Conjunction (and) | p ∧ q
Disjunction (or) | p ∨ q
Exclusive Or | p ⊕ q
Implication | p ⟶ q 
Biconditional | p ⟷ q
```

### Compound Propositions

Propositions formed from existing propositions using logical opporators 

### Negation ( ¬ )

Let _p_ be a proposition. The _negation of p_, denoted by _¬p_, is the statement 
> "It is not the case that p."
The proposition _¬p_ is read "not _p_". The truth value of the negation of _p_, ¬p, is the opposite of the truth value of _p_

#### Examples

```
p: "Michael's PC runs Linux."
¬p: "It is not the case that Michael's PC runs Linux."

p: "Vandana's smartphone has at least 32GB of memory."
¬p: "It is not the case that Vandana's smartphone has at least 32GB of memory." or "Vandana's smartphone has less than 32GB of memory."
```
