## Propositions

### Definition
A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true, or false, but not both.

#### Examples

```
2 + 2 = 4
This is a proposition. 

2 + 2 = 5
This is a proposition. A proposition can be false.

Turn in your homework on Wednesday.
This is a command. This command doesn't have a truth value

Akjsdf!
This is not a proposition. This is gibberish.

Who are you?
This is a question which means it doesn't have a truth value

x + 1 = 2.
This is not a proposition. This statement is neither true or false. This statement can be turned into a proposition if we assign a value to x.

x + y = z.
This is not a proposition. This statement is neither true or false. This statement can be turned into a proposition if we assign values to the variables.

Every positive even integer can be written as the sum of two primes 
This is a proposition. We don't know if it is true or false, but we know it's either true or false.
```

### Logical Opporators 

```
Negation(not) | $/neg$ p
Conjunction (and) | p $/wedge$ q
Disjunction (or) | p $/vee$ q
Exclusive Or | p ⊕ q
Implication | p $/rightarrow$ q
Biconditional | p $/leftrightarrow$ q
```

### Compound Propositions

Propositions formed from existing propositions using logical opporators 

### Negation ( $/neg$ )

Let _p_ be a proposition. The _negation of p_, denoted by _$/neg$p_, is the statement 
> "It is not the case that p."
The proposition _$/neg$p_ is read "not _p_". The truth value of the negation of _p_, $/neg$p, is the opposite of the truth value of _p_

#### Examples

```
_p_: "Michael's PC runs Linux."
_$/neg$p_: "It is not the case that Michael's PC runs Linux."

_p_: "Vandana's smartphone has at least 32GB of memory."
_$/neg$p_: "It is not the case that Vandana's smartphone has at least 32GB of memory." or "Vandana's smartphone has less than 32GB of memory."
```
